Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women, but early detection greatly improves the chances of successful treatment. The symptoms may include unusual vaginal bleeding (especially after intercourse or between menstrual cycles), foul-smelling discharge, pelvic pain, and discomfort during sexual activity. Some women may also experience urinary problems or leg swelling in advanced stages.

Causes are often linked to persistent infection with high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV), smoking, weakened immunity, and a history of multiple pregnancies. Regular Pap smears and HPV testing are vital for early detection.

Treatment options depend on the stage of the cancer. For early-stage cases, surgery such as hysterectomy or conization may be performed. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are commonly used in more advanced stages. Targeted therapies and immunotherapy are also emerging as effective modern approaches. Preventive measures include HPV vaccination, safe sexual practices, and routine screening.
